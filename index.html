      As I walked towards the Lightings section to check the production line, I overheard two production assemblers talking about a trainee who they thought was up to their standards. Beautiful and a fine woman as they described. At first, I didn't pay attention, but as they continued to speak, they suddenly saw the trainee they were talking about so my eyes were immediately drawn to her, and to my surprise I was stunned and I think It was love at first sight. From then on, I would always pass by the production area just to catch a glimpse of her. I would leave sticky notes on her tumbler, too shy to speak to her. But fate had a way of bringing us together as I met her aunt, who also worked at the same company. Little did I know that they were relatives, all I knew was that her aunt was kind and a joy to be around. I asked for her aunt's Facebook, and we became friends. One day, as I was scrolling through my feed, I saw a post from her aunt and to my amazement, the trainee I had been admiring was in the picture. I couldn't believe it! I stalked her Facebook profile, and that's when I found out that she was related to her aunt. Was it destiny? Because of this, I found a way to talk to her, and we became chatmates. Our relationship grew stronger, and I started courting her until the silver anniversary of our company. I was chosen, along with other coworkers, to perform in a band, and I was the lead guitarist. As I played my guitar, I could see in her eyes how impressed and smitten she was with me. And on that day, I finally got the answer I was waiting for - she said yes, and we officially became a couple.

As I stand here, looking at the love of my life, I can't help but smile as I remember how our story began. It was an unexpected encounter that led to a love that I never knew existed. From being strangers to friends to lovers, we went through many obstacles, but we overcame them all because of our love. And now, as we celebrate our wedding day, I can't help but feel grateful for the journey that brought us here. To my dear wife, you are the light that brightens up my life, and I promise to love and cherish you for all eternity. I am blessed to have found you, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Here's to forever, my love.
